  <li>You would use a for loop over a while loop when you don't want to write a true or false statement.
  While loop is used for an indefinite amount of iterations, but for loops have a set number of iterations.
  To calculate the sum of a geometric series with two end values, you would use a for loop rather than a
  while loop.
