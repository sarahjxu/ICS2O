<br>There are <b>many</b> reasons why people are concerned that cell phones (also known as <i>"mobile"</i> or <i>"wireless"</i>
<br>telephones) might have the potential to cause certain types of <b>cancer</b> or other health problems: Cell phones emit
<br>radiofrequency energy (radio waves), a form of non-ionizing radiation, which can penetrate the skull.
